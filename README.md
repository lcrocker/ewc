WARNING! This is some old (2009) code currently in mid-hack that probably
won't even run. I'm putting it here for safekeeping and plan to get back
to it. For now, consider it educational only.

EWC - An extensible implementation of WikiCreole markup.

The markup language implemented by EWC is pretty faithful to WikiCreole
(http://wikicreole.org), with one major addition: the ability to specify
CSS class and id attributes.  It also implements some built in extensions
and facilities for library users to add their own.

Also included is a command-line utility using the library.
More details can be found in the docs directory.

EWC was initially created by Lee Daniel Crocker (http://piclab.com/lee)
in April of 2008.
