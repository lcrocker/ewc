<div><h1>Introduction</h1><p>This document describes a text format (&ldquo;EWC&rdquo;) based on
<a href="http://wikicreole.org/">WikiCreole</a> with extensions and
style markup.
This document is written in EWC itself, so the source text serves
as a fairly complete example, albeit one that is necessarily
much more complex than typical.</p><p>EWC is an errorless syntax.
This means that any sequence of characters on input has a specific
unique meaning, and an EWC processor should not fail parsing input
(though it might certainly not parse it in a way the user expects!)
Generally speaking, any markup that isn't formed exactly as
expected is simply ignored, causing the output to contain the
improper markup characters.
External code is invoked to process <i>extensions</i>, and such code
is strongly encouraged to be similarly tolerant of malformed input,
though this cannot be enforced.</p><p>Although EWC is intended for HTML applications, it can be parsed
into a document object model that can be output in other forms.
DocBook, in particular, should be relatively simple.</p><h2>General rules</h2><p>The syntax of EWC involves only ASCII (7-bit) text, though source
texts may be in any format and encoding compatible with Unicode.
Internally, all data is maintained in Unicode, and all code
points outside the ASCII range just represent themselves.</p><p>Regardless of its original storage format or structure, a text is
interpreted as a sequence of <i>lines</i>, each of which is a sequence
of Unicode code points.
Code points 0x0000&ndash;0x0008, 0x000A&ndash;0x001F, and 0x007F&ndash;0x009F
should be removed from the input and are ignored (note that this
includes the standard line-end characters; this just means that the
input is broken into lines by whatever standard means the operating
system has, but line-end characters <i>within</i> the resulting lines
are not allowed and should be removed.)
Whitespace at the end of each line is ignored and should be removed.
The tab character 0x0009 is allowed, but has no specific meaning
in the syntax other than as general whitespace, and is simply passed
through to the output (unless it appears where the syntax would
remove whitespace).
Treatment of codes in Unicode &ldquo;private use&rdquo; areas is undefined.</p><p>There is no enforced maximum on the allowable length of a line.
Applications should preserve EWC exactly as they encounter it,
except for removing whitespace and illegal characters as specified.
There are applications, though, that may wish to temporarily break
long lines into smaller ones to facilitate editing or display in various
contexts (for example, to display diffs).
Such applications must reassemble the lines as found before
committing them back to storage.
It is recommended that for this purpose, lines should be broken
at the last space character (codes 0x0009 or 0x0020) on or before
the seventy-sixth character of the line.
Where there are no space characters in the first seventy-six
characters of the line, the line is broken after the seventy-fifth, and
some visual indication (preferably distinguishable from an ordinary
hyphen character) of this fact should be made.
The specification of a line-breaking procedure in this document is
intended to make the user experience of EWC applications more
consistent in those areas where line breaking is necessary or useful.</p><p>Blank lines (that is, lines with zero characters) are also significant
in the syntax.
Lines containing only spaces are considered &ldquo;blank&rdquo; for the purposes
of this syntax.
Multiple blank lines are syntactically equivalent to a single blank line,
and can be collapsed.
One or more lines blank lines at the end of an EWC text may all be removed,
as can blank lines at the beginning.</p><h3>Escape character</h3><p>The tilde (<tt>~</tt>, 0x007E) character acts as a general-purpose escape,
in that it will supress the special treatment of the following character.
To produce a tilde in the output, use two consecutive tildes.
This procedure happens at the very first level of text processing.</p><h3>Line continuation</h3><p>Input lines that end with an odd number of backslash (<tt>\</tt>, 0x005C)
characters cause the parser to concatenate that line with the next,
removing the last backslash, and treating the result as a single line
for further processing.
Multiple lines may be continued in this way.
This procedure happens immediately after escape character handling,
so that one can use a tilde to escape the a final backslash to render a
line ending with a backslash.
Lines continued in this way
can be treated as single lines for all purposes.
Lines ending with an even number of backslashes are not affected, as it
is assumed that these will be later interpreted as forced line breaks
(see below).</p><h1>Block-level structure</h1><p>An input text as a whole will be divided into block-level elements:
paragraphs, headings, horizontal rules, lists (three types), and tables.
Block-level elements are separated by blank lines in the input, or by
any syntax that indicates the transition from one block type to another.
For example, the beginning of a table or list ends the previous paragraph,
but a blank line is needed to separate two tables or two paragraphs.</p><h2>Paragraphs</h2><p>Text with no other indication of syntax is placed into paragraphs.
Indentations and other whitespace within paragraphs are ignored in the
final output, as are line ends unless a &ldquo;preformatted&rdquo; style (see below)
specifies that they are preserved.</p><h2>Line breaks</h2><p>Two backslash characters in source text indicates a
forced line break.
That is, the following text will be rendered on a new line, while remaining
in the current paragraph or other block element.
A line containing nothing but two backslashes indicates a paragraph
break within an enclosing block such as a table cell or list item, and can
be used where a blank line would otherwise close the table or list.</p><div class="_y_g"><div class="code _y_first _y_u"><div class="boxed"><p>This
paragraph
will be
line-wrapped,
except for\\ the forced\\ line breaks.</p></div></div><div class="_y_u"><div class="boxed"><p>This
paragraph
will be
line-wrapped,
except for<br /> the forced<br /> line breaks.</p></div></div></div><h2>Headings</h2><p>An input line beginning with two or more consecutive equals sign
(<tt>=</tt>, 0x003D) characters indicates a heading.
The number of equals signs determines the level of the heading: two
specifies a highest-level heading, three the next lower level, and so on.
Whitespace between the equals signs and text is ignored.
If the input line ends with a sequence of equals signs, these (and any
whitespace before them) are removed.
Inline markup is allowed within the text.</p><div class="_y_g"><div class="code _y_first _y_u"><div class="boxed"><p>== First level heading ==
Paragraph.
=== __Second__ //level// heading
Another paragraph.
==== Third level ====
===== Fourth level =====
====== Fifth level ======</p></div></div><div class="_y_u"><div class="boxed"><h1>First level heading</h1><p>Paragraph.</p><h2><span class="u">Second</span> <i>level</i> heading</h2><p>Another paragraph.</p><h3>Third level</h3><h4>Fourth level</h4><h5>Fifth level</h5></div></div></div><h2>Rules</h2><p>A line containing only four or more hyphen (<tt>-</tt>, 0x002D) characters
indicates a horizontal rule, like this:</p><hr /><h2>Lists</h2><p>A group of lines each beginning with one or more of the characters
asterisk (<tt>*</tt>, 0x002A), pound sign (<tt>#</tt>, 0x0023), colon
(<tt>:</tt>, 0x003A), or semicolon (<tt>;</tt>, 0x003B), create lists.
The asterisk character marks a simple unordered bullet list.
The pound sign marks an ordered list, typically numbered.
Colons and semicolons are used for &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; lists, where the
semicolon marks the term, and colon marks a definition.
Lists can be nested by putting multiple marker characters at the
beginning of each line.
Here are some examples:</p><div class="_y_g"><div class="code _y_first _y_u"><div class="boxed"><p>* Unordered
* Bullet
* List
# Ordered
# List
; Term
: Definition:
Items can span lines
* One
** One.One
** One.Two
**# One.Two.One
**# One.Two.Two
* Two</p></div></div><div class="_y_u"><div class="boxed"><ul><li>Unordered</li><li>Bullet</li><li>List</li></ul><ol><li>Ordered</li><li>List</li></ol><dl><dt>Term</dt><dd>Definition:
Items can span lines</dd></dl><ul><li>One<ul><li>One.One</li><li>One.Two<ol><li>One.Two.One</li><li>One.Two.Two</li></ol></li></ul></li><li>Two</li></ul></div></div></div><h2>Tables</h2><p>Tables are made by encoding one or more consecutive table rows,
in either of two ways.
It is not necessary to introduce the table itself: the presence of the first
row is sufficient.
In WikiCreole-compatible style, each input line begins with a single
pipe (<tt>|</tt>, 0x007C) character, and each line represents one
table row, regardless of its contents.
In extended style, each table row must begin with a double pipe,
and input text is placed into that row until the next row begins
with a double pipe.
In both styles, cells within a row are separated by pipes.</p><p>The first character of a table cell can be one of three special notations.
An equal sign (as used for headings) marks the cell as a table heading
rather than a normal cell.
A less-than sign (<tt>&lt;</tt>, 0x003C) causes that table cell to be merged
with the cell to the left (note that the sign looks like it is pointing to the left).
Finally, a caret (<tt>^</tt>, 0x005E) causes the cell to be merged with the
cell above (note that it appears to point upward.)
Multiple column spans and row spans can be marked this way.
Any text contained in a spanned cell is ignored.
Whitespace at the start and end of cell text is removed, so that tables
can be laid out in a visually clear way in the source text.
Here are some samples:</p><div class="code boxed"><p>||= 1         |= 2         |= 3          |= 4         |= 5
|| One        | Two        | Span1       | Span2      |&lt;
|| First      | Second     |^            | Fourth     | Fifth
|| Text spanning
two lines     | 2
| 3           | 4          | 5</p><p>| WikiCreole | compatible | style
| one table row | per input line
This text starts a paragraph.</p></div><p><br /></p><div class="boxed"><table><tr><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>One</td><td>Two</td><td rowspan="2">Span1</td><td colspan="2">Span2</td></tr><tr><td>First</td><td>Second</td><td>Fourth</td><td>Fifth</td></tr><tr><td>Text spanning
two lines</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr></table><table><tr><td>WikiCreole</td><td>compatible</td><td>style</td></tr><tr><td>one table row</td><td>per input line</td></tr></table><p>This text starts a paragraph.</p></div><h1>Images</h1><p>Text inside double curly braces (<tt>{</tt> and <tt>}</tt>, 0x007B and 0x007D)
is used to include images.
Text before the first pipe character indicates the address of the image,
which may be a complete URL or a name that gets translated into a URL
based on some namespace.
Text after the pipe becomes the alternative text of the image.
Alternative text is not parsed for markup.</p><h1>Comments</h1><p>Text inside double curly braces, where the first character is an exclamation
(<tt>!</tt>, 0x0021), is interpreted as a comment.
This text will be retained in the document, but marked so that it will not
be displayed.
Note that this differs from extension comments&mdash;extension comments
are removed completely, and will not appear in the output at all.
Curly-brace comments appear in the output, but marked for non-display.
Also, special-purpose EWC processors may interpret the contents of a
comment to produce special effects on output.
The contents of curly-brace comments are not parsed for markup.</p><h1>Links</h1><p>Text inside double square brackets
(<tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt>, 0x005B and 0x005D) defines links.
Text before the first pipe character indicates the target of the link,
which may be a complete URL or a name that gets translated into a URL
based on some namespace.
Text after the pipe becomes the contents of the link.
The text contents of a link are parsed for inline markup, and may
contain images.</p><p>Note: naked URLs in text are <i>not</i> automatically converted to links
as they are in many wikis, unless explicitly specified in software.</p><h2>Internal link names</h2><p>Link names with no namespace prefix are interpreted as the name
of an &ldquo;internal&rdquo; page.
Such names are first mangled in a well-defined way, then appended
to a base URL defined by the application.
Name mangling proceeds as follows: first, leading and trailing
whitespace is removed.
Then, all alphabetic characters are lowercased&mdash;internal names
are therefore case-insensitive.
Finally, characters from the set (<tt>&ldquo;:\&rdquo;'%&amp;?&lt;&gt;[]{}*+<br />/`;:@=|$&rdquo;</tt>)
are encoded as a $ character followed by a 2-digit
lowercase hex ASCII value.</p><h1>Extensions</h1><p>Functions of EWC can be extended in many ways by the use of
<i>extensions</i>, which are snippets of code or other text that are
replaced with other text and markup.
Extensions begin with double &ldquo;angle brackets&rdquo;, or less-than
(<tt>&lt;</tt>, 0x003C) characters, and are closed with double
greater-than (<tt>&gt;</tt>, 0x003E) characters.
Immediately after the opening brackets is the name of the
extension, which specifies exactly how it is to be processed.
The simplest extensions may have only a name; most will at least
have some text after the name (and some whitespace), and
some may have a block of text ending with the closing <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>
at the start of a line.
Examples are shown below for the built-in extensions.</p><p>Care must be taken with the closing brackets of an extension:
Inline extenstions are closed at the first occurrence of <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>
on the same line, and block extensions are closed by the first
line beginning with <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>.
If these occur inside text that is meant to be included in the
extension, the extension code itself must provide some means
of escaping them, or some other means must be used (this is
often a simple matter of using the extension twice in the case
of comments or raw sections, as detailed below).</p><h2>Comment</h2><p>The simplest extension simply removes its contents altogether,
so it can be used to place commentary <i>about</i> the text in the
text that will not be rendered in the output.
For example:</p><div class="_y_g"><div class="code _y_first _y_u"><div class="boxed"><p>Line &lt;&lt;comment XYZ 123&gt;&gt; one.
Line &lt;&lt;! Here's a much
longer comment.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; two.</p></div></div><div class="_y_u"><div class="boxed"><p>Line  one.
Line  two.</p></div></div></div><h2>Raw</h2><p>The <tt>raw</tt> extension causes its contents to be rendered
exactly, without being processed for markup, much like the tilde
escape does for single characters.</p><div class="_y_g"><div class="code _y_first _y_u"><div class="boxed"><p>{{{
&lt;&lt;.not-a-style&gt;&gt;
//not italic// **not bold**
}}}
&lt;&lt;raw
* Not a
* list
|| Not | a | table
&gt;&gt;</p></div></div><div class="_y_u"><div class="boxed"><p>&lt;&lt;.not-a-style&gt;&gt;
//not italic// **not bold**
* Not a
* list
|| Not | a | table</p></div></div></div><p>Note that the text is still line-wrapped as a paragraph&mdash;it merely
ignores the markup.
One must use the <tt>pre</tt> or <tt>code</tt> styles (see below)
to prevent that.</p><h2>Include</h2><p>Double dollar sign (<tt>$</tt>, 0x0024) characters surrounding certain
pre-defined variable names are replaced with the value of the variable.</p><h2>Footnotes</h2><h1>Styles</h1><p>Block elements and spans of text can be marked with style tags, identifying
that element or span so that an external style sheet can act upon it.
(the details of what a stylesheet does and how to program one are beyond
the scope of this document).
Style tags are delimited by double curly braces (<tt>{</tt> and <tt>}</tt>,
0x007B and 0x007D).
Immediately following the opening braces is a name, possibly preceded
by a single number sign character.
If the name starts with a number sign character, then the name is treated
as a unique identifier for the tagged element.
Without the number sign (which will be the case for most tags), the name
identifies a <i>class</i> of elements that share some property.
Many style classes are predefined: for example, the class <tt>red</tt>
can be used to identify an element that should have its text colored red.</p><p>If the name in a style tag is immediately followed by the closing braces,
the tag will apply to the element following (there are more specific rules
about what that means in ambiguous cases, but they generally do the
&ldquo;right&rdquo; thing).
Otherwise, the style applies to the text inside the braces.
A special case is an opening tag at the start of a line with no closing:
this begins a section of text that includes many block elements, and
is closed only by double closing braces at the start of a line.
Here are some examples, using all built-in style classes.</p><div class="_y_g"><div class="code _y_first _y_u"><div class="boxed"><p>&lt;&lt;.right&gt;&gt;
This paragraph will
be right-justified</p><p>This paragraph is normal,
but &lt;&lt;.red these words&gt;&gt; are red.</p><p>You can nest
&lt;&lt;.sm INLINE &lt;&lt;.strikeout STYLES&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like this.</p></div></div><div class="_y_u"><div class="boxed"><p class="right">This paragraph will
be right-justified</p><p>This paragraph is normal,
but <span class="red">these words</span> are red.</p><p>You can nest
<span class="sm">INLINE <span class="strikeout">STYLES</span></span> like this.</p></div></div></div><p>An identifier such as <tt>#section-1</tt> above has no specific
effect, but serves to identify the section to a stylesheet that
may choose to do something specific with it.
Also, these identifiers can be used as the target for
internal links.</p><p>Multiple sections can be closed on a line (as are
<tt>#section-1</tt> and <tt>yellow-bg</tt> in the example.
These <i>must</i> appear at the beginning of a line, closed style tags
may appear between the section close and new section open,
and only one section open may appear, at the end of the line
(and the line can contain only these block style tags).</p><p>Some commonly used built-in style classes include <tt>pre</tt>
for &ldquo;preformatted&rdquo; text (that is, line breaks within the text will be
preserved rather than wrapping), <tt>code</tt> for text that is
both preformatted and in a monspace font (for code listings),
<tt>wrap</tt> to restore normal line wrapping (perhaps within a
larger preformatted section), <tt>strikeout</tt> to indicated
deleted sections of text in legal documents, and <tt>quote</tt>
to indicate a block-style quotation.</p><p>A few &ldquo;magic&rdquo; style classes cause some automatic side-effects.
The classes <tt>pre</tt> and <tt>code</tt>, for example, not only cause
the text of an element and its subelements to treat input text as
preformatted, but also supresses the special character translations
noted below for things like dashes and quotes.
The class <tt>comment</tt> causes its contents to appear in the
output as comments&mdash;note that this differs from text inside a
comment extension, which is removed from the output entirely.</p><h3>Shortcuts</h3><p>The classes <tt>i</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, <tt>u</tt>, <tt>tt</tt>, <tt>sub</tt>, and <tt>sup</tt>
can be applied to a span by using shortcut characters, as shown in this table:</p><table><tr><th>Markup</th><th>Result</th><th>Notes</th></tr><tr><td>Normal text</td><td>Normal text</td><td /></tr><tr><td><tt>**Bold**</tt></td><td><b>Bold</b></td><td>At start of line followed by space, <tt>**</tt>
will be treated as list item.</td></tr><tr><td><tt>//Italic//</tt></td><td><i>Italic</i></td><td /></tr><tr><td><tt>__Underline__</tt></td><td><span class="u">Underline</span></td><td /></tr><tr><td><tt>##Monospace##</tt></td><td><tt>Monospace</tt></td><td>Same note as <tt>**</tt> above</td></tr><tr><td><tt>Sub,,script,,</tt></td><td>Sub<sub>script</sub></td><td /></tr><tr><td><tt>Super^^script^^</tt></td><td>Super<sup>script</sup></td><td /></tr></table><h1>Special character translations</h1><p>In order to facilitate the entry of common non-ASCII characters such as
proper dashes and quotation marks, a few character sequences are
replaced after all block-level and inline markup processing.
A sequence of three hyphen (<tt>-</tt>, 0x002D) characters is replaced
with an em dash&mdash;like this.
Two hypens is replaced with an en dash, for use in numeric ranges
such as 0&ndash;10.
Single and double quotation marks (<tt>'</tt>, 0x0027, <tt>"</tt>, 0x0022)
are replaced by &ldquo;curly&rdquo; quotes, as indicated by context.
The algorithm for translating quoatation marks tries to be smart and
makes some assumptions about ordinary English text.
Where this fails, the use of the escape character (see below) may be
needed, or curly quotes can be added directly by whatever means the
host operating system allows.
This processing does not occur in &ldquo;preformatted&rdquo; sections of text.</p><h1>Compatibility</h1><p>The major incompatibility between EWC and WikiCreole is the fact that
multiple text lines can be added to list items and table cells.
For example, this markup:</p><div class="code"><p>* Unordered
* List
Text line</p></div><p>in WikiCreole will produce a list followed by a paragraph with the text
&ldquo;Text line&rdquo;.
In EWC, &ldquo;Text line&rdquo; will be part of the second list item.
A blank line (or the start of a table or different list type) is <i>required</i>
to end the list.</p><p>Likewise for tables: they must be terminated with a blank line to avoid
adding following text to the last table cell.
This does not apply to tables in &ldquo;single-line mode&rdquo;, which behave just
like WikiCreole tables (except that cells cannot begin with &ldquo;^&rdquo; or &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo;).</p><p>The second incompatibility is the double-bar style of table markup.
Despite these two differences, most WikiCreole texts should port
directly to EWC without modification, and EWC texts can be converted
the WikiCreole simply and automatically (adding blank lines where
needed, for example).</p><p>WikiCreole specifies the use of &ldquo;&lt;&lt;&rdquo; for extensions, but does not
specify the semantics of any extensions.
WikiCreole text that uses extensions other than those specified by EWC
will produce unexpected results.</p></div>
